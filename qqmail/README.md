This dataset includes [censored keyword combinations](https://github.com/citizenlab/chat-censorship/blob/master/qqmail/censored.txt) that we discovered to censor email messages on QQMail.  This dataset also includes [extenuating keyword combinations](https://github.com/citizenlab/chat-censorship/blob/master/qqmail/extenuating.csv), each of whose presence disables one or more censored keyword combinations from censoring.

See [Measuring QQMailâ€™s automated email censorship in China](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3473604.3474560) for more details.
